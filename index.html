<h1>Why I want to visit Chongqing (eventually)
</h1>

<div class="main">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Chongqing is the largest city in China, with a landmass of around 82,000km<sup>2</sup>, making it around 1/3 of the size of the entire UK and slightly larger than Austria, and is home to around 30,000,000 people. The city is renowned for its engineering, technology, transportation and history
    (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Chongqing"><span>reference</span></a>).
  </p>
  <p>Below are some images that illustrate the different sights common in Chongqing but perhaps surreal to the rest of the world.

  <h1>Reasons I want to go</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>As seen in the leftmost image, the drone light shows every Saturday are spectacular.</li>
    <li>The city itself is constructed in vertical layers, and is structurally impressive.</li>
    <li>Shopping plazas such as <i>The Ring</i> (rightmost image) are vast spaces and are rather uniquely designed, the particular example of <i>The Ring</i> has a jungle theme inside.</li>
    <li>Aside from these, the entire city has a unique sci-fi aesthetic that I find appealing.</li>
    </ol>
